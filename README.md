# Library Management System Project 2 by Hamid

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Library Management System
**Level**: Intermediate  
**Database**: `library_project_2_zero_analyst`

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Library Management System using SQL. It includes creating and managing tables, performing CRUD operations, and executing advanced SQL queries. The goal is to showcase skills in database design, manipulation, and querying.

## Objectives

1. **Set up the Library Management System Database**: Create and populate the database with tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the data.
3. **CTAS (Create Table As Select)**: Utilize CTAS to create new tables based on query results.
4. **Advanced SQL Queries**: Develop complex queries to analyze and retrieve specific data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**
```sql
create database library_project_2_zero_analyst;
```
 
- **Table Creation**: Created tables for branches, employees, members, books, issued status, and return status. Each table includes relevant columns and relationships.
```sql
--creating table branch
drop table if exists branch;
create table branch 
	(
		branch_id varchar(5) primary key,
		manager_id varchar(5),
		branch_address varchar(15),
		contact_no varchar(15)
	);

--creating table employees
drop table if exists employees;
create table employees 
	(
		emp_id varchar(6) primary key,
		emp_name varchar(20),
		position varchar(9),
		salary varchar(7),
		branch_id varchar(7)
	);

alter table employees
alter column salary type varchar(20);

--creating table books
drop table if exists books;
create table books 
	(
		isbn varchar(20) primary key,
		book_title varchar(25),
		category varchar(20),
		rental_price float,
		status varchar(5),
		author varchar(20),
		publisher varchar(25)
	);
```

### Import Data
There was issue importing data into books table because of the book_title column being too short so altered the table's column to increase its size

```sql
alter table books
alter column book_title type varchar(75);

alter table books
alter column author type varchar(50);


--creating table issued_status
drop table if exists issued_status;
create table issued_status
	(
		issued_id varchar(10) primary key,
		issued_member_id varchar(10), --fk
		issued_book_name varchar(20),
		issued_date date,
		issued_book_isbn varchar(20), --fk
		issued_emp_id varchar(6) --fk
	);

alter table issued_status
alter column issued_book_name type varchar(75);

--creating table members
drop table if exists members;
create table members
	(
		member_id varchar(7) primary key,
		member_name varchar(20),
		member_address varchar(25),
		reg_date date
	);

--creating table return_status
drop table if exists return_status;
create table return_status
	(
		return_id varchar(8) primary key,
		issued_id varchar(8),
		return_book_name varchar(25),
		return_date date,
		return_book_isbn varchar(8)
	);

ALTER TABLE return_status
ADD Column book_quality VARCHAR(15) DEFAULT('Good');

UPDATE return_status
SET book_quality = 'Damaged'
WHERE issued_id 
    IN ('IS112', 'IS117', 'IS118');

SELECT * FROM return_status;
```

## Foreign key constraints
```sql
alter table issued_status
add constraint fk_members_id
foreign key (issued_member_id)
references members(member_id);

alter table issued_status  --table where we add col from another table as fk
add constraint fk_book_isbn --cmd for adding constraint and its name
foreign key (issued_book_isbn) --the col as a fk (name from the 2nd table)
references books(isbn); --1st table and the name of col over there

alter table issued_status
add constraint fk_emp_id
foreign key(issued_emp_id)
references employees(emp_id);

alter table return_status
add constraint fk_issued_id
foreign key(issued_id)
references issued_status(issued_id);

alter table employees
add constraint fk_branch_id
foreign key(branch_id)
references branch(branch_id);
```

### verifying all the data if imported correctly
```sql
select * from books;  --35 rows 
select * from branch; --5 rows
select * from employees; --11 rows
select * from issued_status; --35 rows
select * from members; --12 rows
select * from return_status; --14 rows
```
## PROBLEMS AND ANALYTICS
### 2. CRUD Operations

- **Create**: Inserted sample records into the `books` table.
- **Read**: Retrieved and displayed data from various tables.
- **Update**: Updated records in the `employees` table.
- **Delete**: Removed records from the `members` table as needed.

Task 1: **Create a New Book Record -- "978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.')"**
```sql
select * from books;  --always see the data before solving the problem
insert into books (isbn, book_title, category, rental_price, status, author, publisher)
values ('978-1-60129-456-2', 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Classic', 6.00, 'yes', 'Harper Lee', 'J.B. Lippincott & Co.');
```
Task 2: **Update an Existing Member's Address**
```sql
select * from members; 
update members
set member_address = '124 Main St'

Task 3: **Delete a Record from the Issued Status Table -- Objective: Delete the record with issued_id = 'IS121' from the issued_status table.**
```sql
select * from issued_status; --35 rows
delete from issued_status where issued_id = 'IS121'; --34 rows
```
Task 4: **Retrieve All Books Issued by a Specific Employee -- Objective: Select all books issued by the employee with emp_id = 'E101'.**
```sql
select issued_book_name from issued_status where issued_emp_id = 'E101';
```
Task 5: **List Members Who Have Issued More Than One Book -- Objective: Use GROUP BY to find members who have issued more than one book.**
```sql
select issued_member_id, count(issued_id) as no_of_books_issued 
from issued_status group by issued_member_id having count(issued_id)>1;

select issued_member_id, count(*) from issued_status
group by 1 having count(*)>1;

('C1190','John','146 main street','2025-05-01');

select * from members
where reg_date >= current_date - interval '180 days'
```
Task 10: **List Employees with Their Branch Manager's Name and their branch details:**
```sql
select * from branch;

select e1.*, b.branch_id, e2.emp_name as manager	
	from employees e1

branch b on e1.branch_id = b.branch_id
join 
employees e2
on b.manager_id = e2.emp_id;
```
Task 11. **Create a Table of Books with Rental Price Above a Certain Threshold**

issued at least one book in the last 2 months.**
```sql
select 
	issued_member_id
	from issued_status
where
	issued_date > current_date - interval '6 months';

--to get the member's names as well; i had to join the members table's as well
create table active_members as
select m.member_id, m.member_name, ist.issued_date  from members as m
join 
issued_status as ist
on m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
where
	issued_date > current_date - interval '6 months';

--we can use subquery as well to get the names
create table active_members_subquery as
select * from members

number of books processed, and their branch.**
```sql
select e.emp_name, b.*, count(ist.issued_id) as no_of_books_issued  from issued_status as ist
join employees as e on e.emp_id = ist.issued_emp_id
join branch as b on b.branch_id = e.branch_id
group by 1,2 order by no_of_books_issued desc limit 3
```
Task 18: **Identify Members Issuing High-Risk Books
Write a query to identify members who have issued books more than twice with the status "damaged" 
in the books table. Display the member name, book title, and the number of times they've issued damaged books.**
```sql
--first make some books as 'damaged'
update return_status
set book_quality = 'Damaged'
where issued_id in ('IS107', 'IS108', 'IS109', '1S113', '1S114', '1S115');

select m.member_name, count(*) as damaged_books from members as m
join issued_status as ist on m.member_id = ist.issued_member_id
join books as bk on bk.isbn = ist.issued_book_isbn
join return_status as rs on rs.issued_id = ist.issued_id
where rs.book_quality = 'Damaged'
group by 1
having count(*) > 2;
```
Task 19: **Stored Procedure Objective: Create a stored procedure to manage the status of books in a library system. 
Description: Write a stored procedure that updates the status of a book in the library based on its issuance. 
The procedure should function as follows: The stored procedure should take the book_id as an input parameter. 
The procedure should first check if the book is available (status = 'yes'). If the book is available, it should be issued, 
and the status in the books table should be updated to 'no'.
If the book is not available (status = 'no'), the procedure should 
return an error message indicating that the book is currently not available.**
```sql
select * from books;
select * from issued_status;	

create or replace procedure issue_book(p_issued_id varchar(10), p_issued_member_id varchar(10), p_issued_book_isbn varchar(20),
p_issued_emp_id varchar(6))

Language plpgsql
As $$

Declare 
	v_status varchar(5);
Begin
		select status
		into
			v_status
		from books where isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;
		
		if lower(v_status) = 'yes' then
			insert into issued_status(issued_id, issued_member_id, issued_book_isbn, issued_emp_id)
			values(p_issued_id, p_issued_member_id, p_issued_book_isbn, p_issued_emp_id);

		update books
		set status = 'No'
		where isbn = p_issued_book_isbn;

		raise notice 'Book record added successfuly for the book isbn: %', p_issued_book_isbn;
		
		else
				raise notice 'Sorry the book you requested is unavailable isbn: %', p_issued_book_isbn;

		end if;
End;
$$

select * from issued_status;
select * from books
where isbn = '978-0-553-29698-2'; --now the status would have changed to 'no' after issuing the mentioned isbn book

--978-0-553-29698-2     'Yes'
--978-0-7432-7357-1     'No'

call issue_book('IS155', 'C108', '978-0-553-29698-2', 'E102');
